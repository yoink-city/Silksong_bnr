## What does this mod do?
- This mod makes *you* play as hornet! There's some other fun stuff in it but we'd rather you find it as you play :) 

### What version of Hollow Knight is compatible?
- Currently this mod exists only for Hollow Knight 1.5

### How to install?
- Copy the contents of the zip into your game's Mods directory
